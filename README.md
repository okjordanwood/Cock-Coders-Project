## ⚙️ How to Run

To run the Cock Coders LMS application, follow these steps:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download it from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or use an open-source alternative like OpenJDK.

2.  **Navigate to the Source Directory:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the `src` directory within the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/Cock-Coders-Project/src
    ```

3.  **Compile the Java Files:**
    Compile all the Java files from the `src` directory. The compiled `.class` files will be placed in their respective package directories (`backEnd` and `ui`).
    ```bash
    javac .\backEnd\*.java .\ui\*.java
    ```
    *Note: Depending on your operating system and shell, you might need to adjust the path separators (e.g., use `/` instead of `\`).*

4.  **Run the Application:**
    After successful compilation, run the application by executing the `UIDriver` class:
    ```bash
    java ui.UIDriver
    ```
    This will launch the application, starting with the landing page.

5.  **Sample Login Credentials:**
    The application includes sample login credentials for testing:
    *   **Teacher:**
        *   Username: `john_w`
        *   Password: `jword123`
    *   **Student:**
        *   Username: `calebrb`
        *   Password: `cword123`
